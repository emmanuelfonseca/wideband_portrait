Wideband Portrait Algorithms
============================

This is a working directory for the development of Python algorithms that 
generate a two-dimensional profile "portrait" across pulse phase and 
observing frequency. See Demorest et al. (2013) and Pennucci, Demorest 
and Ransom (2014) for early examples of such software.

There are several different types of signal-smoothing techniques 
available: 

 - wavelet thresholding
 - principal component analysis 
 - total-variation denoising (coming soon)

... and more to come!

## Required packages and libraries

 - numpy
 - PyWavelet (http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets/)
 - matplotlib
 - aspProfile (provided here)
