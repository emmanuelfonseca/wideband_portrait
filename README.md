Wideband Portrait Algorithms
============================

This is a working directory for the development of algorithms that 
generate a two-dimensional profile "portrait" across pulse phase and 
observing frequency. See Demorest et al. (2013) and Pennucci, Demorest 
and Ransom (2014) for early examples of such software.

Current available algorithms use: wavelet thresholding... and more to come!

## Required packages and libraries

 - numpy
 - PyWavelet (http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets/)
 - matplotlib
 - aspProfile (provided here)
